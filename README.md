### Abstract
 
Social media platforms allows users to share their personal informations and opinions and to follow other users ones. In
recent years such kind of platform number has increase and for the most popular sites even the number of user has
increase in a sensitive manner. As result, today On-line Social Networks (OSN) groups lot of information about people,
communities and their behaviour, preferences, connections and location. In last few years some works show that user
personal attributes and also other sensitive data can be inferred from on public available informations. This work focus on
inference methods, purposing a review of at present day state-of-art and discussing about techniquesâ€™ effectiveness and
possibles improvements. We, otherwise, leave apart the question on of how we can prevent information inference attacks.
